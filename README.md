### Hey, I'm Lucas Trevisan! 👋🏻

I'm graduated in computer science and I have a passion for visual things. Today I work as front-end engineer at objective solutions.

- I love to use `neovim` as my code editor and `unix` base systems. Currently using `MacOS`.
- I use daily `.js`, `.ts`, `.html`, `.css`, `.rs`, `.lua`.
- I'm currently learning `ui/ux` and trying to make my neovim experience even better creating plugins!
