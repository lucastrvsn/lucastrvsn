### Hey, I'm Lucas Trevisan! 👋🏻

I'm graduated in computer science and I have a passion for visual things. Today I work as front-end engineer at oowlish 🦉.

- I love to use `neovim` as my code editor and `unix` base systems, currently using `macOS `.
- I use daily `.js`, `.ts`, `.html`, `.css`, `.rs`, `.swift`.
- I'm currently learning swift for macOS development and creating plugins for neovim ✨
