### Hey, I'm Lucas Trevisan! 👋🏻

I'm graduated in computer science and I have a passion for visual things. I work as front-end engineer at trustedhousesitters 🐶

- I use `neovim` as my code editor and `unix` base systems, currently using `macOS `
- I use daily `.js`, `.ts`, `.rs`, `.lua`
- I'm currently learning rust and creating plugins for neovim ✨
