### Hey, I'm Lucas Trevisan!

I'm graduated in computer science and I have a passion for visual things. Today I work as front-end engineer at objective solutions.

- I love to use `neovim` as my code editor and `unix` base systems
- I use daily `.js`, `.ts`, `.html`, `.css`, `.rs`
- I'm currently learning `ui/ux` and `wayland`
- I like to do some low level stuff. Currently working on a (experimental) window manager for wayland.
